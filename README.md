#Clustering_FE_MCA
👋 Hi, I’m @mohammadbadi  
👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, Business Analytics or Business Intelligence. I love uncovering insightsfrom data that drive business decisions.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in data analytics and business intelligence as part of my MBA in Financial and Management Analytics.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects and opportunities in Data Analytics, especially within the Toronto market.  
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me an email.  
😄 Pronouns: he/his  
⚡ Fun fact: I’m a coffee enthusiast who finds inspiration in every cup and loves transforming complex data into actionable insights.

This project showcases my expertise in unsupervised machine learning by demonstrating how thoughtful, systematic analysis can control and extract insights from seemingly "black-box" methods. I analyzed auto theft patterns in Toronto using advanced clustering techniques—specifically KMeans and DBSCAN—to uncover hidden trends in the data. Rather than accepting the typical lack of control in unsupervised learning, I took charge by performing thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing, and data reduction. I employed the K-Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and iteratively tested various feature combinations. By selecting the top five models and executing clustering on the full dataset, I ensured that the final results were robust and insightful. This rigorous approach underscores my critical thinking, smart coding practices, and adaptability in leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems.

This repository is Approach 2 of the CrimeAnalytics_Clustering. In this approach Frequency Encoding is used in all categorical coloumns and PCA is done on the Spatial Features. OCC_DOW is engineered into 3 new features: Weekend, Week-Beginning, Mid-Week. The Code Sections of this repository compliments the analysis done in Code Sections of CrimeAnalytics_Clustering. This repository is mainly created and executed to cross-check any bias in the primary models (CrimeAnalytics_Clustering) and ensure that models created are robust. Please visit the Code Sections of main model (CrimeAnalytics_Clustering/Code Sections/6.1 3D Visualizations of Top 5 Clusters.ipynb) to see the dynamically interacting 3D Clustering visuals, which serve as the outcome of all Clustering models.

Thank you!
regards, Mohammad Badi.
